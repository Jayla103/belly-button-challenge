This project is focused on creating an interactive dashboard that lets you explore a dataset of microbes found in human navels.
We used the samples.json file as our main dataset for building everything.
The index.html file is what youâ€™ll open to view the dashboard in a browser.
The main functionality is handled in app.js, which contains all the JavaScript code that powers the dashboard.
